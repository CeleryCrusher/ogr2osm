## Tests
Test your code and make sure it passes. cram is used for tests:

 1. Make sure you have `libxml2-utils`, `osmctools` and  `protobuf-compiler` installed on your system and the [optional-requirements.txt](optional-requirements.txt) installd in your python env.
 2. Install `cram`: `pip install cram`
 3. Run `cram`: `cram test/`

Changes in speed-critical parts of the code may require profiling.
